# Image2Map

A Fabric mod that allows you to render an image onto a map. Inspired by the Bukkit plugin ImageOnMap.

![Some images](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/TheEssem/Image2Map/master/images.png)

To render an image, just run this command like so:
```
/mapcreate "<path to image URL>"
```
Currently, you will need to put the image URL in quotes due to Brigadier limitations.

## Build

Building is simple provided you have a working JDK:
```
./gradlew build
```
